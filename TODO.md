# Potential Tool Ideas

- [ ] support more image types (I have temporarily given up on heic/heif, i could convert heic to png/jpeg but not the other way, unsure if i should add what I got working)

- [ ] merge images to make PDF (with draggable order using page previews)
- [ ] PDF Merging (also with draggable order controls)

- [ ] QR Code Generator (with modes for url, emails, phone numbers, contacts, etc)

- [ ] Note taking with tags for filtering
- [ ] TODO with (priority + duedate) sorting

- [ ] Spinning wheel (random picker from user options e.g. names, numbers, etc)
